# yii2-bootstrap-touch-slider
Implementation of bootstrap-touch-slider from bootstrapthemes.co as Yii2 widget

[bootstrapthemes.co](https://bootstrapthemes.co/demo/resource/BootstrapCarouselTouchSlider/)

## Installation  
### Composer
````bash
composer require easyrider7522/yii2-bootstrap-touch-slider "@alpha"
````

or manually add to the `required` section of your project's composer.json
````json
"easyrider7522/yii2-bootstrap-touch-slider": "@alpha"
````
and run `composer update` shell command

Since it's a pre-release (currently in alpha state) stability flag `@alpha` must be used with the package (as you can see above) in order to be able to install it without changing minimum-stability property, which is global for your whole project.
